1. we can store the data in 2 table with certain columns:
	TABLE 1- THE BOARD:
	width- to store board's width, for display and game purposes.
	height- same purposes.

	TABLE 2- A WORD:
	the word - what word the user need to find
	the index of the start of the word - to know where to place the word on the board and where to check the user for the word.
	the meaning (hint) for the word - for the purposes of the game
	the type of the word (Across/Down) - to know how to display the word, check the user's letters and place on the board.
	

2. In my opinion, the following information should not be stored in the table:
	index of each word- it can be found using the available data (across/dowm + LEN(word) + the current square the user is in)
	length of the word- using LEN(word) will find it
	blank spaces- in the board, any square with no letter in it will be a blank space without the need to store these.




4. THE COMMANDS: 

	create table Board(two int width, height);
	insert into Board values(40, 50);
	select * from Board;
	>> 40|50
	
	create table Word(three string word, meaning, acrossORdowm, one int startIndex);
	insert into Word values('word', 'combination of letters', 'down', 6);
	select * from Word;
	>> word|combination of letters|down|6
